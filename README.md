# Introduction

This project implements Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to enhance document processing capabilities. RAG leverages a combination of retrieval mechanisms and generative models to produce high-quality, contextually relevant text outputs. This approach is particularly effective for tasks such as question answering, summarization, and information extraction from large document collections.
